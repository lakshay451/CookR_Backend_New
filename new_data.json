When the skillet is hot, add the salmon and cook until browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Then cover the skillet, turn off the heat, and leave it for 3 minutes to steam it and cook the inside of the fish.",

      "To assemble the salads: Divide the salad greens between 2 plates. Place a piece of salmon in the center of each plate. Divide the grapefruit relish between the 2 plates and sprinkle the scallions on top. Serve immediately.",
      "How to supreme a grapefruit: Cut the top and bottom off the whole grapefruit, then place it on a cutting board. Start at the top and following the curve of the fruit, run the knife down the length of the fruit to cut the peel off. Repeat until all the peel is removed. Cut closely enough so that you take off all the pith (the white part) but not too deeply so that you waste the fruit. To remove the segments, hold the grapefruit over a bowl and carefully slice inward along the membrane on both sides of a fruit segment, then remove the fruit segment; repeat this for all fruit segments. Once you're done, squeeze the membrane to get all the juice out. For this dish, we need all the grapefruit segments, but only 1 teaspoon of the grapefruit juice. (I drink the leftover grapefruit juice mixed with sparkling water for a very refreshing drink.)"

Once your grill has heated up brush it with some olive oil and place the portabello caps directly on the grill. They will need about 2 minutes or so per side max. Meanwhile mix your mayo, ancho chili powder, powdered dried chipotle and a dash of lime juice in a metal bowl with a wisk till smooth in color. Once the portobello caps are done let them stand on a cutting board for about 2 minutes. Cut the grilled caps in thin strips about 1/2 an inch thick. Now you can start assembly but make sure your grill is still on medium to high heat. Spread a layer of the mayo on the bottom piece of bread, then put the pieces of portabello in on thin layer. Next layer on a thin layer of the pablano followed by the pickle and lastly the swiss cheese. Lastly cover with the top part of the bread. Do this for both. Once assembled wrap in tin foil till it is air tight and squeezed well but not too hard. Now take the sandwiches and put them directly on the grill with the top side up and lay a frying pan, cast iron prefered, on top to \"press\" them down a bit into the grill. Late about 1-2 minutes pass, lift the pan, flip the sandwiches over and do the same with the pan for about 1-2 minutes. Take them off the grill and let rest for about a minute. You can now either slice in half or if serving at a party slice into 2 inch pieces."

Whisk the egg yolk and cream together and to the flour and butter, pulse until the dough comes together, it will be shaggy but thats ok, test it by pinching a piece and if it holds together it's fine if not and it's still crumbly add more cream 1 tsp at a time until it's cohesive when pinched together by hand (Don't over work in the processor) I had to add an additional tsp of cream to mine. Divide in two, press into disks and refrigerate for an hour. Pre heat the oven to 375, line tart pan or tartlet pans, prick with fork and place in freezer for 30 minutes. Place a piece of parchment in the tart pan or pans and pour in pie weights or beans. Bake 20 minutes remove the parchment and weights and place back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool on rack.",

Whisk in the juice and 2 tsp of zest and pour into sauce pan. Cook at medium low heat stirring constantly until the sugar has melted and it's hot to the touch. Now add the butter one piece at a time stirring constantly until the butter is melted. Place thermometer in and continue cooking until it reaches a temperature of 175 degrees. Remove from heat.\r\nPour through a sieve into a bowl or large measuring cup, add 1 tsp of orange zest stir to combine and cover with plastic that sits directly on top of the curd, allow to come to room temperature then refrigerate overnight.\r\nPour the chilled curd in the blender with the cream cheese and the rest of the orange zest and blend until thick and creamy. Spoon into container and refrigerate\r\nuntil ready to use.",
      "Ganache-Heat the cream to scalding, chop the chocolate and place in mixing bowl, pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth, add the liquor and stir. Let the ganache come to room temperature stirring frequently. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to thicken a bit you want the ganache to be thick but still pourable.",
      "Spoon the chilled orange cream into the tart shell filling the shell halfway. Pour the ganache on top of the orange cream and return to the refrigerator where it needs to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and some candied orange zest."

      "Before you do anything else, get out a small saucepan and pour 11/2 bottles of hard cider into it. Let it simmer while you're getting the rest of your things together. Reduce to 11/2 cups. Drink the remaining 1/2 bottle of cider - it's good for you.",
      "Put the half package of achiote seasoning in a blender or food processor with the 1/4 cup of lime juice, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 cup of the reduced hard cider. Blend until smooth.",
      "Using latex gloves (achiote stains something terrible) smear the entire pork roast with the achiote-cider blend. Cover and let marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight in the refrigerator, if you want).",
      "When you're ready to cook, place the roast in your slow cooker with all the marinade, and add the remaining 1/2 cup of reduced cider. Scatter the onion around, toss in the stick of cinnamon, and cook on low setting for 6 hours, until the meat is tender and falling apart. If you want to use the banana leaves, here's where you do it. Unfold the leaves cut two 2-foot sections. One by one, place them over a low burner on your stove for a few seconds on either side, moving the leaf so that the whole leaf gets warmed. You'll see it changing color to a darker green. Line your slow cooker with the leaves (one lengthwise, one crosswise) before you put the roast in, and fold the leaves over the top of the roast before you cover it up for cooking. I cannot stress enough how little difference this makes to the flavor of the dish, but it is traditional, so . . . whatever.",
      "Remove the roast to a large platter and tent with foil. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick, degrease the braising liquid, and pour into a saucepan. Set over medium heat and reduce by half (or to about 1 cup). If the liquid is less than a cup, add the juice of one lime and another 1/2 bottle of hard cider, and reduce to approximately 1 cup.",
      "After the meat has rested for at least 15 minutes, roughly shred it and put on a serving platter (if you want to line the serving platter with banana leaves, that looks nice and traditional, but again - totally unnecessary). Pour the reduced marinade over the shredded pork, cover, and place in a warm oven until ready to serve.",

      "HABANERO SALSA (can be made as much as a week ahead): Heat an ungreased skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lay in the unpeeled garlic and the chiles. Toast, turning frequently, until blotchy brown in spots appear. This will take about 5 minutes for the habaneros, and 10 to 15 minutes for the garlic.",
      "Let the garlic cool a few minutes, until you can handle them, and peel the skins off. Put the garlic in a blender or food processor. With the motor running, drop in the habaneros one at a time. When all are in, add the lime juice, cider, vinegar, and 11/2 teaspoos salt. Run the blender until it is all smooth.",
      "Add the granny smith apple and place on the table with a stern warning that it is not for the faint of heart.",
      "PICKLED ONIONS (can be made a day or three ahead): Boil two cups of water. Place the onion slices in a bowl, pour the boiling water over them, count to five, and then drain them immediately.",
      "Put the onion slices in a bowl (or a re-sealable plastic bag) with the lime juice, the cider, the cider vinegar, and about a half-teaspoon of salt. Toss to make sure the lime juice coats all the onion, and set aside for 1 hour.",
      "In a dry non-stick pan over medium heat, cook the sliced apple until browned but still al dente.",

I usually add a palm of this and dashes of that without measuring but the important part is to add a little and then taste to see if the flavor profile is where you want it. Go for bare minimums at this point as more can be added later and as the pot boils the flavors will become more evenly distributed.",
      "Last comes the hot sauce. Use whatever you like or leave it out altogether. For me, it makes the dish. I use Blair's Ultra Death Sauce which is around 800,000 Scoville heat units. or pretty seriously hot if you're not a chili head. About half a teaspoon in six quarts of soup will make it completely inedible for anyone who doesn't like spicy foods, seriously hot for most who do, and just right for those of us who breathe fire for fun.",
      "Put a lid on the pot and simmer for about an hour and a half or until the potatoes are cooked through. Stir at least every twenty or thirty minutes. Taste occasionally, especially towards the end to see if anything needs to be added."
