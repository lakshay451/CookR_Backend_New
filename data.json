Start at the top and following the curve of the fruit, run the knife down the length of the fruit to cut the peel off. Repeat until all the peel is removed. Cut closely enough so that you take off all the pith (the white part) but not too deeply so that you waste the fruit. To remove the segments, hold the grapefruit over a bowl and carefully slice inward along the membrane on both sides of a fruit segment, then remove the fruit segment; repeat this for all fruit segments. Once you're done, squeeze the membrane to get all the juice out. For this dish, we need all the grapefruit segments, but only 1 teaspoon of the grapefruit juice.

Whisk in the eggs and Dijon mustard until the cream cheese is mostly mixed in (a few lumps are fine). Stir the egg mixture into the skillet with the shallots, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the eggs have firmed. They will still be softer than normal scrambled eggs because of the cream cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper just as the eggs are ready to come out of the pan."

      "Get your grill warmed up to a medium heat. Take your two portabello caps and squeeze half a lime on both sides and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Once your grill has heated up brush it with some olive oil and place the portabello caps directly on the grill. They will need about 2 minutes or so per side max. Meanwhile mix your mayo, ancho chili powder, powdered dried chipotle and a dash of lime juice in a metal bowl with a wisk till smooth in color. Once the portobello caps are done let them stand on a cutting board for about 2 minutes. Cut the grilled caps in thin strips about 1/2 an inch thick. Now you can start assembly but make sure your grill is still on medium to high heat. Spread a layer of the mayo on the bottom piece of bread, then put the pieces of portabello in on thin layer. Next layer on a thin layer of the pablano followed by the pickle and lastly the swiss cheese. Lastly cover with the top part of the bread. Do this for both. Once assembled wrap in tin foil till it is air tight and squeezed well but not too hard. Now take the sandwiches and put them directly on the grill with the top side up and lay a frying pan, cast iron prefered, on top to \"press\" them down a bit into the grill. Late about 1-2 minutes pass, lift the pan, flip the sandwiches over and do the same with the pan for about 1-2 minutes. Take them off the grill and let rest for about a minute. You can now either slice in half or if serving at a party slice into 2 inch pieces."

Whisk the egg yolk and cream together and to the flour and butter, pulse until the dough comes together, it will be shaggy but thats ok, test it by pinching a piece and if it holds together it's fine if not and it's still crumbly add more cream 1 tsp at a time until it's cohesive when pinched together by hand (Don't over work in the processor) I had to add an additional tsp of cream to mine. Divide in two, press into disks and refrigerate for an hour. Pre heat the oven to 375, line tart pan or tartlet pans, prick with fork and place in freezer for 30 minutes. Place a piece of parchment in the tart pan or pans and pour in pie weights or beans. Bake 20 minutes remove the parchment and weights and place back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool on rack.",

Whisk in the juice and 2 tsp of zest and pour into sauce pan. Cook at medium low heat stirring constantly until the sugar has melted and it's hot to the touch. Now add the butter one piece at a time stirring constantly until the butter is melted. Place thermometer in and continue cooking until it reaches a temperature of 175 degrees. Remove from heat.\r\nPour through a sieve into a bowl or large measuring cup, add 1 tsp of orange zest stir to combine and cover with plastic that sits directly on top of the curd, allow to come to room temperature then refrigerate overnight.\r\nPour the chilled curd in the blender with the cream cheese and the rest of the orange zest and blend until thick and creamy. Spoon into container and refrigerate\r\nuntil ready to use.",
      "Ganache-Heat the cream to scalding, chop the chocolate and place in mixing bowl, pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth, add the liquor and stir. Let the ganache come to room temperature stirring frequently. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to thicken a bit you want the ganache to be thick but still pourable.",

Unfold the leaves cut two 2-foot sections. One by one, place them over a low burner on your stove for a few seconds on either side, moving the leaf so that the whole leaf gets warmed. You'll see it changing color to a darker green. Line your slow cooker with the leaves (one lengthwise, one crosswise) before you put the roast in, and fold the leaves over the top of the roast before you cover it up for cooking.
